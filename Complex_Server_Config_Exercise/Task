 III.   DHCP Server:


1. Install and configure the DHCP role on the server.

2. Set the lease duration to half of the default lease time for wired connections.

3. Ensure that each installed client machine always receives the same IP address.

4. Configure the client workstations to dynamically obtain an IP address from the DHCP server.


  IV.  Certificate Services:

1. Install and configure the certificate services role.

2. Issue certificates using RSA cryptography and SHA256 hashing algorithm with a key length of 2048 bits.


   V.  Backup:


1. Install the necessary services for performing backups.

2. Schedule a daily full backup from the FTP location at 4:00 AM.

3. Perform a backup to HDD4 with the specified settings.


  VI.  VPN Connection:

1. Install and configure the necessary role service for the network policy server providing remote access on the server.

2. Allow VPN connections only for members of the previously created group between 06:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays.

3. Create the appropriate network policy rule on the network policy server to enable VPN connections.

4. Test the connection by establishing a VPN connection from a workstation.

    
VII.   Secure Website:

2. Add the web name to the appropriate DNS lookup zone (create if necessary) and make the websites accessible with the specified protocols and ports.

3. Check and install missing IIS web server role services.

4. Stop the default website.

5. Create a new website with a default document as an HTML file.

6. Request a domain certificate for the web server and set it up for the website. Ensure the website is only accessible via SSL protocol on port 4343. Automatically redirect to the secure connection if accessed non-securely.

7. Restrict access to the website to users in the previously created group using Group Policy:
      Configure Internet Explorer to automatically open with the homepage set to "http://web.company.local" and prevent users from changing it.
      Allow web access only with a client certificate provided automatically by Group Policy to users.


 VIII.   File Server Role:

1. Configure the following settings using the File Server role:
      Prevent users from storing files with the extensions .com, .exe, .txt in their home folders.
