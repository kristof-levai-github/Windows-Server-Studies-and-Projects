# Contributions

As this repository primarily serves as an archive of my past school projects and studies, I am not actively accepting contributions directly to this repository.

# Disclaimer

Please note that the projects and studies in this repository reflect my understanding of Windows Server during my school years. While I strive for well-documented and effective configurations, there may be areas for improvement as I continue to grow as a Windows Server administrator.

# Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the work of Papp Lajos for creating these learning materials and exercises related to Windows Server. While I have learnt and completed these practical exercises, the credit for their design and creation goes to him. I am grateful for the effort and expertise that went into developing these.

Happy server management!
